# Robot Carol Calculator
This is a very simple calculator written for/in RobotCarol, a program/language used to teach basic programming concepts to children. It was mainly written as a fun challenge in remembrance of a binary calculator I wrote in RobotCarol back in highschool, but I think it also shows quite well how much is possible even in a very simple language (RobotCarol is turing complete after all, at least if you had an infinite world).
